# Minecraft Bedrock (1.20) Fallen Kingdoms
Fallen Kingdoms behaviour pack for Minecraft Bedrock

# How it works
- Add it as a behaviour pack
- You will spawn with a stick, when used, the menu to choose your team will be opened
- Choose your team
- You will get a firework rocket that should be used on the center of your base to defined it

After that, following Fallen Kingdoms rules are enforced:
- in the overworld, you can't place block outside of your base except tnt, torch, lever and boat
- you can't break blocks inside other bases

## TODO
- add support for more than 2 teams
- add the mcpack file in release (zip renamed)
